# Lorem Ipsum

This is the readme.md file.
I wonder if this will be published, or the index.md file.
This is publishing one sentence per line.
It will generate as a single paragraph, or at least it should.
The next "Commit" will test that.

Let's see!

## Heading 2

Some text

**This Is Bold**
* One
* Two
* Three

Just a line here.

### Now Heading Three
- One
- Two
- Three

## Back to Heading 2
1. one
2. two
3. three


Then some text.
More text.
Single lines, written one per line.
They should blend into a single paragraph.
They truly are easier to read this way.
I wonder if they are easier to type.
It certainly does help me to visualize the whole thing.
